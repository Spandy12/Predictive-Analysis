# Predictive-Analysis

The data was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains of various parameters which are considered to be important factors in the holistic approach taken by UCLA's Admission Committee.

Our goal is to analyse the data provided and check which factors play the most important role towards achieving a high chance of admission.

The Regression model file consists of our regression analysis and linear regression and random forest model to run the data on.

# Note: The dataset provided does not indicate if an individual did get admission in UCLA.

Thus, for the purposes of implementing various classification models, we have considered that a person with a 82% chance of admission, does in fact get acceptance from UCLA.

A bigger dataset would definitely help us analysing the data better and it would also give us a clearer picture of how various features actually affect a candidate's admission chance in UCLA.
